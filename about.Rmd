## About the Project

*Tutorial Project*

This is a project about the tutorial and completing the tutorial.

### Goals

* To complete the tutorial
* To create a new site for my actual final project
* Because this one kinda sucks and it's easier to create a new one.
  + This is because I'm going to be trying to do cool things on the new one so this one acts as a test.
